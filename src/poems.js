            Sometimes in the kitchen at midnight,
            <br />
            clad in her pajamas,
            <br />
            squinting and shielding her eyes from the light,
            <br />
            Mom found me snacking on raisins,
            <br />
            or on peanut butter and bread.<div className="spacer"></div>
            “What’re you doing up so late?” she’d whisper,
            <br />
            not waking Dad and my brothers and sisters.
            <br />
            “You shouldn’t eat before bed.”<div className="spacer"></div>
            Then she’d sit at the table, just to be with me.
            <br />
            She’d spend a few more minutes there,
            <br />
            whispering questions and listening
            <br />
            to my hushed, grateful replies.<div className="spacer"></div>
            Heading back to her and my father’s bedroom,
            <br />
            she’d gently urge me
            <br />
            to join my sleeping siblings soon.
            <div className="spacer"></div>
            After her visit, my appetite always vanished,
            <br />
            and slipping under the covers
            <br />I felt loved enough to sleep.<div className="spacer"></div>

            Under this comforter my love and I rest,
            <br />
            beneath the comforter her brown beach towel
            <br />
            covering her from head to toe.
            <br />
            She’s slept this way for years, she says,
            <br />
            this Linus blanket for extra warmth
            <br />
            and, I suppose, for extra love.
            <div className="spacer"></div>
            Lying beside her, I say:
            <br />
            “Take that damn towel off.
            <br />
            You’re twenty–four years old, for Christ’s sake.
            <br />
            You’ve got me, why do you need
            <br />
            that stupid towel?”<div className="spacer"></div>She keeps it on
            her, snuggling happily.<div className="spacer"></div>I persist: “You
            don’t need that towel.
            <br />
            You’ve got me. You act like a child
            <br />
            with that thing. C’mon, take it off.”<div className="spacer"></div>
            She turns over, tightly clutching
            <br />
            her warm brown towel.<div className="spacer"></div>I try pulling it
            off her.
            <br />
            She grips it tightly.
            <br />
            <p>
              I pull <i>really</i>, <i>really</i> hard.
            </p>
            <br />
            She holds on.<div className="spacer"></div>Tired of struggling,
            <br />I move under the towel and into her arms.
            <br />I kiss her eyelid.
            <br />
            The hell with it, I think.
            <br />
            You’ll just share her with this stupid towel.
            <div className="spacer"></div>I hold her close,
            <br />
            feeling good in her arms, in her life.
            <br />
            She—not where we live—
            <br />
            is my home, <br />
            and I want to be with her forever.<div className="spacer"></div>Now
            she moves deeper into our embrace,
            <br />
            and the brown towel, like a magic carpet, <br />
            floats out from under the comforter
            <br />
            and flies away.<div className="spacer"></div>

            My father rose early,
            <br />
            much before school time.
            <br />
            We’d hear his work boots clunk
            <br />
            on the kitchen floor,
            <br />
            his key ring jangle,
            <br />
            hushed voices of him and Mom over coffee
            <br />
            speaking of the day ahead.
            <br />
            Then he’d march off,
            <br />
            to saw and hammer, according to design,
            <br />
            beside others like him.<div className="spacer"></div>Home from
            school, we tiptoed by the couch,
            <br />
            where he napped before his evening job.
            <br />
            Awake, he was a stubbled face,
            <br />a smoke–roughened voice—we treaded lightly.
            <br />
            He’d return at midnight,
            <br />
            while we slept, or pretended to,
            <br />
            telling scary stories in bed.
            <br />
            Mom invoked his name when her own tactics failed.
            <br />
            Now and then we felt his hand, large and callused,
            <br />
            sting our bottoms.<div className="spacer"></div>One summer, he took
            two weeks off
            <br />
            to build a playroom in the cellar.
            <br />I helped sort the new two–by–fours,
            <br />
            smooth like the foreheads of lovable horses:
            <br />
            Flicka, Trigger, the Black Beauty
            <br />
            Mom read to us on rainy afternoons.
            <br />I sat on the beams while he sawed.
            <br />
            He held them still while I sawed.
            <br />
            We worked all day, made peanut-butter sandwiches
            <br />
            with gobs of jelly, chocolate milk four tablespoons a glass
            <br />
            (lucky Mom was at Nana’s).
            <div className="spacer"></div>We talked a lot those two weeks,
            <br />
            he and I, about fourth grade,
            <br />
            tools, about baseball.
            <br />
            He said he’d take us to the circus
            <br />
            when it came to town.
            <br />
            That summer there were extra bills;
            <br />
            he had to work more overtime.
            <br />
            When the circus came, Mom took us.<div className="spacer"></div>

            <div className="spacer"></div>Now sixty–six, with hair as sparse
            <br />
            as our newborn daughter’s,
            <br />
            my father still rises early,
            <br />
            remodeling the homes he once helped build.
            <div className="spacer"></div>Once a month Deb and I drive up
            <br />
            and sit with them around the old Formica table.
            <br />I give my father little Susie to hold.
            <br />
            He takes her as if she might break
            <br />
            or start to cry and he’d have to hand her back.
            <div className="spacer"></div>Mom makes coffee, and she and Deb and
            I talk.
            <br />I look at my father, our tiny daughter <br />
            nestled in his aging arms.
            <br />
            He smiles awkwardly, then looks away,
            <br />
            remembering when, because of need, and design,
            <br />
            he didn’t spend time with his children.

            When he grew up,
            <br />
            his mother hid them from him,
            <br />
            her box of sanitary napkins,
            <br />
            the used ones he never found
            <br />
            in the bathroom wastebasket.<div className="spacer"></div>
            Once he saw a pair of her “bloomers”
            <br />
            floating in the pail by the washing machine.
            <br />
            The water was pale red, and he remembers
            <br />
            her angry, ashamed reply when he asked why.
            <div className="spacer"></div>
            Now his girlfriend’s warm, rolled–up pad
            <br />
            stares at him from the sink ledge,
            <br />

            this most natural of things.

            Roseanne was a short skinny girl
            <br />
            in my class with a lovely giggle,
            <br />
            and she’d giggle and smile
            <br />
            at just about anything.<div className="spacer"></div>
            And old Sister Grace Geraldine
            <br />
            with the white whiskers

            saw Roseanne giggling and smiling and laughing.
            <div className="spacer"></div>

            <br />
            between our miniature desks,

            and smacked the shit out of little Roseanne.

            This afternoon she flashed me,
            <br />
            she who’s always been so shy,
            <br />
            perfect circles of softness

            staring at my face, then gone,
            <br />
            hidden beneath her sweater.<div className="spacer"></div>I just
            smiled.
            <br />
            It was the middle of the day,

            her flash an interruption,
            <br />a suggestion she’s leaving her room,
            <br />
            full–force, unchained,

            ready to take the world by surprise.<div className="spacer"></div>

            A guy coming into the bathroom, I’m going out—
            <br />
            we squeeze past each other in the doorway,
            <br />
            and he cowers a little, a frail, frightened doe;
            <br />
            the bully in me, shaped by a trillion superficial images,
            <br />
            deems him repulsive; his shirt’s untucked, his hair’s a bit mussed;
            <br />I get the impulse to pounce on him, shove him into a corner,
            <br />
            call him a scumbag, see what he’ll do; his face is pockmarked, <br />
            scarred during teenage years; his body’s small and slight,<br />
            and though I smile and he smiles back, I realize it could take years
            <br />to rid yourself of these thoughts, it could take years and years,<br />
            years and years, years and years to get clean.

            but it’s real, the desire of men
            <br />
            to batter other men’s faces,
            <br />
            maybe man #1 is on the treadmill
            <br />
            with his headphones on,

            “When you’re finished,
            <br />
            can you give me a holler,

            I’ll be on a bike over—”

            but #1 doesn’t hear what #2’s saying,

            #1's been on the treadmill beyond
            <br />
            the 30–minute limit,
            <br />
            and thinks #2’s telling him to get off,

            <br />
            and this angers #2,
            <br />
            who unsure #1 has heard or understood him,
            <br />
            repeats his request, but #1 still doesn't hear him,
            <br />
            and again motions for #2 to get lost,
            <br />
            so slighted #2 calls #1 a “fucking asshole,”
            <br />
            and then they’re rolling on the gym’s rubber floor,
            <br />
            trying to smash each other’s eyeballs,
            <br />
            and #2 is every motherfucker
            <br />
            who bullied #1 when he was a boy,
            <br />
            every teacher who embarrassed him
            <br />
            in front of class, #1 is #2’s abusive father,
            <br />
            the car company that sold him a shitbox,
            <br />
            the fucking IRS,
            <br />
            and by the time they’re separated,

            they’ve pounded each other bloody,
            <br />
            and stand bleeding and gasping for air,
            <br />
            feeling strangely giddy and light,

            each having briefly lessened
