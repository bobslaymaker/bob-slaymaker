        Sometimes in the kitchen at midnight,<br/>
        clad in her pajamas,<br/>
        squinting and shielding her eyes from the light,<br/>
        Mom found me snacking on raisins,<br/>
        or on peanut butter and bread.<br/><br/>
        
        “What’re you doing up so late?” she’d whisper,<br/>
        not waking Dad and my brothers and sisters.<br/>
        “You shouldn’t eat before bed.”<br/><br/>
        
        Then she’d sit at the table, just to be with me.<br/>
        She’d spend a few more minutes there,<br/>
        asking questions and listening to me talk.<br/><br/>
        
        Heading back to her and my father's bedroom,<br/>
        she’d urge me to join my sleeping siblings soon.<br/><br/>
        
        After her visit, my appetite always vanished,<br/>
        and slipping under the covers<br/>
        I felt loved enough to sleep.<br/><br/><br/>

You act like a child<br/>with that thing.  C’mon, take it off.”<br/><br/>She turns over, tightly clutching<br/>her warm brown towel.<br/><br/>I try pulling it off her.<br/>She grips it tightly.<br/>I pull really, really hard.<br/>She holds on.<br/><br/>Tired of struggling,<br/>I move under the towel and into her arms.<br/>I kiss her eyelid.<br/>The hell with it, I think.<br/>You’ll just share her with this stupid towel.<br/><br/>I hold her close,<br/>feeling good in her arms, in her life.<br/>She’s my best friend, <br/>and I fanaticize being with her forever.<br/><br/>Now she moves deeper into our embrace,<br/>and the brown towel, like a magic carpet, <br/>floats out from under the comforter<br/>and flies away.<br/><br/><br/>

They lived in a crowded, single-story house,<br/>six kids, two parents, one grandmother.<br/>The three boys slept in one bedroom,<br/>the three girls in another.<br/>The parents had their room,<br/>the grandmother hers.<br/><br/>
There was never a peaceful moment,<br/>the bathroom the only refuge<br/>before someone pounded the door,<br/>stopping a boy’s mirrored boxing match,<br/>a girl’s imagined ballet. <br/><br/>

Thirty years later, each lives alone,<br/>relishing the quiet, the privacy,<br/>missing the varied human voices,<br/>the many hearts beating as one.

        <br/>We talked a lot those two weeks,<br/>he and I, about fourth grade,<br/>tools, about baseball.<br/>He said he'd take us to the circus<br/>when it came to town.<br/>That summer there were extra bills;<br/>he had to work more overtime.<br/>When the circus came, Mom took us.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Now sixty-six, with hair as sparse<br/>as our newborn daughter's,<br/>my father still rises early,<br/>remodeling the homes he once helped build.<br/><br/>Once a month Deb and I drive up<br/>and sit with them around the old Formica table.<br/>I give my father little Susie to hold.<br/>He takes her as if she might break<br/>or start to cry and he'd have to hand her back.<br/><br/>Mom makes coffee, and she and Deb and I talk.<br/>I look at my father, our tiny daughter <br/>nestled in his aging arms.<br/>He smiles awkwardly, then looks away,<br/>remembering when, because of need,<br/>he didn’t spend time with his children.

        When he lived at home,<br/>
        his mother hid them from him,<br/>
        her box of sanitary napkins,<br/>
        the used ones he never found<br/>
        in the bathroom wastebasket.<br/><br/>
        
        Once he saw a pair of her bloomers<br/>
        floating in the pail by the washing machine.<br/>
        The water was bloody, and he remembers<br/>
        her caustic, evasive reply when he asked why.<br/><br/>
        
        Now his girlfriend's warm, rolled-up pad<br/>
        stares at him from the sink ledge,<br/>
        and he barely recognizes the pink pad,<br/>
        or stomachs what it represents,<br/>
        this part of life,<br/>
        this most natural of things.

        Two women in their twenties stroll by, <br/>
        lovers, holding hands.  The older woman<br/> 
        beside me turns and says, “That’s disgusting.”<br/><br/>
        
        “You’re right,” I reply.  “There’s entirely <br/>
        too much love on the planet today.”<br/><br/><br/>

        "Turn off that Nazi shit,"<br/>
        I told my mother,<br/>
        my innocent, German-speaking mother,<br/>
        who’d tuned in her German-language program<br/>
        while scrubbing the kitchen floor.<br/><br/>
        
        Despite her ancestry,<br/>
        at thirteen I wasn’t German—<br/>
        no, no, not German.<br/>
        I was my father's boy,<br/>
        an all-American Irish kid<br/>
        who watched Hogan's Heroes, Combat,<br/>
        other World War II shows.<br/>
        The word “German” wasn't in my vocabulary.<br/>
        The words “Krauts,” “Sieg Heil!” and “Nazis” were.<br/><br/>
        
        On her knees scrubbing,<br/>
        my beautiful young mother rose,<br/>
        with a silent sigh switched off the radio.<br/><br/><br/>

Roseanne was a short skinny girl<br/>
in my class with a lovely giggle,<br/>
and she’d giggle and smile<br/>
at just about anything.<br/><br/>

And old Sister Grace Geraldine<br/>
with the white whiskers<br/>
saw Roseanne giggling and smiling and laughing.<br/><br/>

And Sister Grace marched down the aisle<br/>
between our miniature desks,<br/>
and smacked the shit out of little Roseanne.<br/><br/>

And that wiped the smile off Roseanne's face,<br/>
and ended her giggling and laughing too.<br/><br/><br/>

        but it's real, the desire of men<br/>
        to batter other men's faces,<br/>
        maybe man #1 is on the treadmill<br/>
        with his headphones on,<br/>

        When you're finished,<br/>
        can you give me a holler,<br/>
        I'll be on a bike over—<br/>
        but #1 doesn't wait till #2's finished,<br/>

        #1's been on the treadmill beyond<br/>
        the 30-minute limit,<br/>

        and then they're rolling on the gym's rubber floor,<br/>
        trying to smash each other's eyeballs,<br/>

        who bullied #1 when he was a boy,<br/>

        they've pounded each other bloody,<br/>
