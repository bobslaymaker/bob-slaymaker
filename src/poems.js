        Sometimes in the kitchen at midnight,<br/>
        clad in her pajamas,<br/>
        squinting and shielding her eyes from the light,<br/>
        Mom found me snacking on raisins,<br/>
        or on peanut butter and bread.<br/><br/>
        
        “What’re you doing up so late?” she’d whisper,<br/>
        not waking Dad and my brothers and sisters.<br/>
        “You shouldn’t eat before bed.”<br/><br/>
        
        Then she’d sit at the table, just to be with me.<br/>
        She’d spend a few more minutes there,<br/>
        asking questions and listening to me talk.<br/><br/>
        
        Heading back to her and my father’s bedroom,<br/>
        she’d urge me to join my sleeping siblings soon.<br/><br/>
        
        After her visit, my appetite always vanished,<br/>
        and slipping under the covers<br/>
        I felt loved enough to sleep.<br/><br/><br/>

        Wake at six, dress in the dark,<br/>
        gobble a piece of toast or two.<br/><br/>
        
        Rush to the bus stop,<br/>
        shuffle your feet<br/>
        to keep warm.<br/>
        The cold wind rips<br/>
        through your torn jeans.<br/>
        Without gloves<br/>
        your fingers freeze.<br/><br/>
        
        All this to get to work<br/>
        before the owner<br/>
        with his new car<br/>
        and refreshed from the burbs.<br/><br/>
        
        He comes in confident, smiling<code>&#8212;</code><br/>
        his daughter won the state spelling bee,<br/>
        his son got into Harvard.<br/><br/>
        
        You’re so happy for him<br/>
        you trip over yourself<br/>
        trying not to kill him,<br/>
        as he closes the door<br/>
        to his warm office,<br/>
        and you step into<br/>
        the cold work yard.<br/><br/><br/>

        “Turn off that Nazi shit,”<br/>
        I told my mother,<br/>
        my innocent, German-speaking mother,<br/>
        who’d tuned in her German-language program<br/>
        while scrubbing the kitchen floor.<br/><br/>
        
        Despite her ancestry,<br/>
        at thirteen I wasn’t German—<br/>
        no, no, not German.<br/>
        I was my father’s boy,<br/>
        an all-American Irish kid<br/>
        who watched Hogan's Heroes, Combat,<br/>
        other World War II shows.<br/>
        The word “German” wasn't in my vocabulary.<br/>
        The words “Krauts,” “Sieg Heil!” and “Nazis” were.<br/><br/>
        
        On her knees scrubbing,<br/>
        my beautiful young mother rose,<br/>
        with a silent sigh switched off the radio.<br/><br/><br/>

They lived in a crowded, single-story house,<br/>six kids, two parents, one grandmother.<br/>The three boys slept in one bedroom,<br/>the three girls in another.<br/>The parents had their room,<br/>the grandmother hers.<br/><br/>
There was never a peaceful moment,<br/>the bathroom the only refuge<br/>before someone pounded the door,<br/>stopping a boy’s mirrored boxing match,<br/>a girl’s imagined ballet. <br/><br/>

Thirty years later, each lives alone,<br/>relishing the quiet, the privacy,<br/>missing the varied human voices,<br/>the many hearts beating as one. <br/><br/><br/>

        When he grew up,<br/>
        his mother hid them from him,<br/>
        her box of sanitary napkins,<br/>
        the used ones he never found<br/>
        in the bathroom wastebasket.<br/><br/>
        
        Once he saw a pair of her “bloomers”<br/>
        floating in the pail by the washing machine.<br/>
        The water was pale red, and he remembers<br/>
        her angry, ashamed reply when he asked why.<br/><br/>
        
        Now his girlfriend’s warm, rolled-up pad<br/>
        stares at him from the sink ledge,<br/>
        and he barely knows what it is,
        or can stomach it,<br/>
        this part of life,<br/>
        this most natural of things.

Roseanne was a short skinny girl<br/>
in my class with a lovely giggle,<br/>
and she’d giggle and smile<br/>
at just about anything.<br/><br/>

And old Sister Grace Geraldine<br/>
with the white whiskers<br/>
saw Roseanne giggling and smiling and laughing.<br/><br/>

And Sister Grace marched down the aisle<br/>
between our miniature desks,<br/>
and smacked the shit out of little Roseanne.<br/><br/>

And that wiped the smile off Roseanne’s face,<br/>
and ended her giggling and laughing too.<br/><br/><br/>
