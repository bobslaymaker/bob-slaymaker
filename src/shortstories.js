It’s shiny and silk, the first piece of lingerie anyone’s ever given me.<div className="spacer"></div>    Kelly notices my cheeks burning and touches my shoulder. <div className="spacer"></div> “I’m sorry,” she says. “Really. I don’t know what makes me say things like that.”<div className="spacer"></div> Because they’re true, I tell myself. Because they’re true.<div className="spacer"></div>    “How much do you think he paid for it,” I ask, moving away from her. I sit on her and John’s bed.<div className="spacer"></div> “Oh, I’m sorry, Stace,” she says, and comes over and hugs me. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean it when I say things like that. Really.”<div className="spacer"></div>   I return her hug, then lie back on the sky–blue bedspread. I cover my face with one of her and John’s pillows.<div className="spacer"></div>    “So, anyway,” I say, taking the pillow off. “How much do you think he paid for it? The label says it’s silk.”<div className="spacer"></div> Kelly holds the teddy against her, and looks in the mirror on the closet door. It looks so good on her, her womanly breasts pushing up beneath the teddy’s shiny silk. I wonder if I’ll fill it, if I’ll even wear it. I think of giving it to her.<div className="spacer"></div>   Excited, she runs over and sits beside where I'm lying.<div className="spacer"></div>   “This is what’ll happen when he sees you in it,” she says. She goes to the dresser, strips off her jeans, blouse and bra, then puts on the teddy, and a pair of black lace stockings. She gets her green knit dress from the closet, puts that on.<div className="spacer"></div>    She comes back and sits next to me.<div className="spacer"></div>   “First,” she says, crossing her legs, “First, he’ll come over and kiss you. He’ll say you look great in your dress.”  <div className="spacer"></div>    She smoothes back her long brown hair, laughs, then smiles at me, and looks in the mirror. <div className="spacer"></div>   “Then, then he’ll kiss you again, and you’ll kiss him back, a long kiss, delicate, but only a little tongue, and only toward the end, very delicate, very light. He’ll run his tongue lightly over your lips.”<div className="spacer"></div>    “And he’ll kneel in front of you. And gently, very gently, he’ll run his hand up your foot, slowly, very slowly, then up your calf, his hand soft and loving, moving very slowly.”<div className="spacer"></div>    “And his hand moves up the bottom of your thigh, till he gets to where there’s no stocking. And he touches your skin, and moves his hand around, to where the garter is. And as he touches it, he lets out a sweet little rush of air, '<i>Aah</i>.'”<div className="spacer"></div> Kelly stands. She touches my shoulder and laughs.<div className="spacer"></div> “And that’s how it’ll happen,” she says, smiling. She goes to the dresser, gathers up her clothes, and disappears into the bathroom.<div className="spacer"></div>“That’s just how it’ll happen,” she shouts. “Just like that.”<div className="spacer"></div>   I know it won’t. But I take the teddy anyway, wrapped as Steve’s given it to me, in its gold box and fancy red ribbon. Getting on the bus at Kelly’s corner, I realize she doesn’t need it. Good things happen to her anyway, without teddies and garters, and lace stockings.<div className="spacer"></div>    When I get home, my mother tells me Steve’s called.<div className="spacer"></div>   “Steve? That you?”  I enter the bathroom, and sit on the toilet lid. He says he wants us to bring in the new year quietly. His parents are going hunting, and we’ll have the whole place to ourselves.<div className="spacer"></div>
            “No party?” I say.<div className="spacer"></div>    “A party of two,” he says. “A party of two and some romance.”<div className="spacer"></div> “You mean screwing,” I say, sort of sharp, though I don’t mean it. We haven’t slept together, but there’s something different about him, something tender.<div className="spacer"></div>    “No,” he says in a serious voice. “Lovemaking.”<div className="spacer"></div>   “What should I wear?” I ask softly. I sit back against the tank and wait for him to answer.<div className="spacer"></div>   “Whatever you like,” he says, and yawns. He clears his throat sleepily. “Wear whatever you like. There’ll be nobody here. You don’t have to impress anyone.”<div className="spacer"></div>  I hang up on him. He’s forgotten about the teddy. He probably didn’t even choose it himself—his sister probably picked it out, and wrapped it.<div className="spacer"></div>    In the mirror, it’s worse than I expected. I’ve always been more or less flat–chested, but in the teddy it’s ridiculous. I cry, the tears streaking down the shiny crimson silk. I’ll give the teddy to Kelly. It’s made for her; she’s got breasts and hips, not me. I’ll wear my usual sleeping–together number, my Pearl Jam T–shirt, and my brightest white panties. The guys I’ve been with have always seemed to enjoy that, to respond to that. At least, that’s the way it’s always seemed.<div className="spacer"></div>   Sitting by the fire New Year’s Eve, I watch Steve rise from the couch, then kneel on the carpet in front of me. I sit up a bit, my legs feeling cool, awkwardly naked.<div className="spacer"></div>    I breathe in and hold my breath to make my breasts fill the dress. But I feel it hanging off me, the cups half–empty. Out of the corner of my eye, I see him secretly checking me out, his glance taking in my non–existent breasts, my non–existent hips. He must be very disappointed, I think, closing my eyes. I fight the urge to run home and change into baggy jeans and a loose flannel shirt.<div className="spacer"></div>    Kneeling on the floor, he touches the hem of my dress, and caresses the soft cotton. Then he takes off my pumps.<div className="spacer"></div>  “You look really good tonight,” he says, smiling.<div className="spacer"></div> “You don’t look so bad yourself,” I manage, voice cracking.<div className="spacer"></div>   He rises on his knees and kisses me. I kiss him back, and he runs his tongue over my lips, lightly, very delicately.<div className="spacer"></div>  I remember what Kelly said.<div className="spacer"></div>   He drops back down, and puts his hand on my foot. Softly, slowly, he runs his hand up my calf, then onto my knee, stopping to fondle it. I’m getting excited, but I don’t breathe, don’t move, and his hand glides smoothly up the bottom of my thigh, fingering the lace stocking. <div className="spacer"></div> When he gets to where the stocking ends, he stops. I watch him smile. His fingers find my garter, and he lets out a sweet little rush of air, "<i>aah</i>,” just like Kelly said he would. And I see Kelly’s face, and beside it John’s. Then their faces disappear, and it’s just me and Steve, me holding him by the fire, kissing him, loving him, rising like any other woman toward the sky.

Every time I see him, I wanna puke.”  <div className="spacer"></div>And on and on. <div className="spacer"></div>You sit down at your desk, discover your boss has already left a job for you—a 100–page handwritten report, half an inch thick. <div className="spacer"></div>The yellow post–it on top says, <i>I want this typed by lunchtime</i>. <div className="spacer"></div>The person collecting Lotto money arrives at the far edge of your department. <div className="spacer"></div>Up to now you haven’t kicked in—you think Lotto is like happy hour and religion, opium to soothe the poor workers’ misery, to keep them numb and dreaming while keeping them in line. <div className="spacer"></div>Also, it would cut into money for writing materials you can’t steal from the supply room. <div className="spacer"></div>For each night, after work, you go straight home and grind out the next few pages of The Novel. <div className="spacer"></div>You are not a secretary, you are a novelist temporarily doing secretarial work, until The Big One sells and you retire with your laptop to the country.<div className="spacer"></div>As the Lotto person slowly makes his way to your area, a blue, toxic–smelling haze descends from the ceiling vent. <div className="spacer"></div>You and everyone else start to sneeze, your eyes begin to water. <div className="spacer"></div>The blue haze is everywhere, and the entire floor's in an uproar. <div className="spacer"></div>The Head Honcho upstairs is called. <div className="spacer"></div>Angry to be disturbed from his meeting, he comes down. <div className="spacer"></div>He phones the maintenance men in the lobby, informs you and the others there’s construction going on in the building. <div className="spacer"></div>They’re using PAN—<i>not acetylene</i>—torches to cut up two old elevator shafts. <div className="spacer"></div>PAN fumes, he assures you—looking at his watch—are in no way harmful to breathe. <div className="spacer"></div>Two of the Hey–It’s–Only–A–Jobbers open their mouths to protest, but the Head Honcho’s gone. <div className="spacer"></div>Everyone goes back to their desks, coughing, tying handkerchiefs bandit–style around their mouths and noses. <div className="spacer"></div>In an effort to protect your eyes, you take the sunglasses from your bag and put them on. <div className="spacer"></div>You think about calling the Institute for Occupational Health and Safety, but remember that’s who you work for. <div className="spacer"></div>Knowing you don't believe in playing the lottery, the Lotto person passes your desk, but you grab him. <div className="spacer"></div>You fish two crumpled dollar bills from your pocket, buy two shares in the pool.<div className="spacer"></div>It’s beginning. You’re becoming a full–fledged office worker.<div className="spacer"></div>Happy hour starts at five. See you there.<div className="spacer"></div><br />
