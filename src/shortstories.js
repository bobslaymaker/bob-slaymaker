Kelly’s holding the crimson teddy against my chest, the teddy Steve's given me for Christmas.  It's shiny and silk, the first piece of lingerie anyone's ever given me.<br/><br/>	Kelly notices my cheeks burning and touches my shoulder.  <br/><br/>	"I'm sorry," she says.  "Really.  I don't know what makes me say things like that."<br/><br/>	Because they're true, I think.  Because they're true.<br/><br/>	"How much do you think he paid for it," I ask, moving away from her.  I sit on her and John's bed.<br/><br/>	"Oh, I'm sorry, Stace," she says, and comes over and hugs me.  "I'm sorry.  I don't mean it when I say things like that.  Really."<br/><br/>	I hug her back, then lie on the sky–blue bedspread.  I cover my face with one of her and John's pillows.<br/><br/>	"So, anyway," I say, taking the pillow off.  "How much do you think he paid for it?  The label says it's silk."<br/><br/>	Kelly holds the teddy against her, and looks in the mirror on the closet door.  It looks so good on her, her womanly breasts pushing up beneath the teddy's shiny silk.  I wonder if I'll fill it, if I'll even wear it.  I think of giving it to her.<br/><br/>	She runs over excitedly and sits beside me on the bed.<br/><br/>	"This is what'll happen when he sees you in it," she says.  She goes to the dresser, strips off her jeans, blouse and bra, then puts on the teddy, and a pair of black lace stockings.  She goes to the closet and takes out her green knit dress, and puts that on.<br/><br/>	She comes back to where I'm lying.<br/><br/>	"First," she says, sitting on the bed and crossing her legs, "First, he'll come over and kiss you.  He'll say you look great in your dress."  She smoothes back her long brown hair, laughs, then smiles at me, and looks in the mirror.  "Then, then he'll kiss you again, and you'll kiss him back, a long kiss, delicate, but only a little tongue, and only toward the end, very delicate, very light.  He'll run his tongue lightly over your lips."<br/><br/>	"And he'll kneel down in front of you. And gently, very gently, he'll run his hand up your foot, slowly, very slowly, then up your calf, his hand soft and loving, moving very slowly."<br/><br/>	"And his hand moves up the bottom of your thigh, till he gets to where there's no stocking.  And he touches your skin, and moves his hand around, to where the garter is.  And as he touches it, he lets out a sweet little rush of air, ahhh."<br/><br/>	Kelly stands up.  She touches my shoulder and laughs.  "And that's how it'll happen," she says, smiling.  She goes to the dresser, gathers up her clothes, and disappears into the bathroom.<br/><br/>	"That's just how it'll happen," she shouts.  "Just like that."<br/><br/><br/><br/>	I know it won't.  But I take the teddy anyway, wrapped as Steve's given it to me, in its gold box and fancy red ribbon.  Getting on the bus at Kelly's corner, I realize she doesn't need it.  Good things happen to her anyway, without teddies and garters, and lace stockings.<br/><br/>	When I get home, my mother tells me Steve's called.<br/><br/>	"Steve?  That you?"  I enter the bathroom, and sit on the toilet lid.  I've gotten him out of a nap, but he says he doesn't mind.  He says he wants us to bring in the new year quietly.  His parents are going hunting, and we'll have the whole place to ourselves.<br/><br/> 
	"No party?" I say.<br/><br/>	"A party of two," he says.  "A party of two and some romance."<br/><br/>	"You mean screwing," I say, sort of sharp, though I don’t mean it.  We haven't slept together, but there's something different about him, something tender.<br/><br/>	"No," he says in a serious voice.  "Lovemaking."<br/><br/>	"What should I wear?" I ask softly.  I coil the cord around my pinkie until my pinkie disappears.  I sit back against the tank and wait for him to answer.<br/><br/>	"Whatever you like," he says, and yawns.  He clears his throat sleepily.  "Wear whatever you like.  There'll be nobody here.  You don't have to impress anyone."<br/><br/>	I hang up on him.  He's forgotten about the teddy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>	In the mirror, it's worse than I expected.  I've always been more or less flat–chested, but in the teddy it's ridiculous.  I cry, the tears streaking down the shiny crimson silk.  I'll give the teddy to Kelly.  It's made for her; she’s got breasts and hips, not me.  I’ll wear my usual sleeping–together number, my Pearl Jam t-shirt, and my brightest white panties.  The guys I've been with have always seemed to enjoy that, to respond to that.  At least, that's the way it's always seemed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>	Sitting by the fire New Year's Eve, I watch Steve rise from the couch, then kneel on the carpet in front of me.  I sit up a bit, my legs feeling cool, awkwardly naked.<br/><br/>	I breathe in and hold my breath to make my breasts fill the dress.  But I feel it hanging off me, the cups half–empty.  Out of the corner of my eye, I see him secretly checking me out, his glance taking in my non–existent breasts, my non–existent hips.  He must be very disappointed, I think, closing my eyes.  I fight the urge to run home and change into baggy jeans and a loose flannel shirt.<br/><br/>	Kneeling on the floor, he touches the hem of my dress, and caresses the soft silk.  Then he takes off my pumps.<br/><br/>	"You look really good tonight," he says, smiling.<br/><br/>	"You don't look so bad yourself," I manage, my voice nearly cracking.<br/><br/>	He rises on his knees and kisses me.  I kiss him back, and he runs his tongue over my lips, lightly, very delicately.<br/><br/>	I remember what Kelly said.<br/><br/>	He drops back down to his knees, and puts his hand on my foot.  Softly, slowly, he runs his hand up my calf, then onto my knee, stopping to fondle it.  I'm getting excited, but I don't breathe, don't move, and his hand glides smoothly up the bottom of my thigh, fingering the lace stocking.  When he gets to where the stocking ends, he stops.  I watch him smile.  His fingers find my garter, and he lets out a sweet little rush of air, ahhh, just like Kelly said he would. And I see Kelly's face, and beside it John's.  Then their faces disappear, and it's just me and Steve, me holding him by the fire, kissing him, loving him, rising like any other woman toward the sky.<br/><br/>

                        <p><span>Originally appeared in Ducts and The Seattle Review<p ><span >&nbsp;</span></p>OH, LOTTO GOD, DELIVER US FROM MISERY<br/><br/>You get up at seven, wash, iron a shirt, stuff something down--an apple, a banana, anything—then rush to the train to try and get a seat.  You get to the station late and have to stand all the way to the city.  At the office, you pass the Hey–It’s–Only–A–Jobbers talking at their desks.  They’re bright and cheery, but you walk on to the department in the far corner, where you work with the This–Office–Is–My–Lifers, who are already complaining.<br/><br/>"My neck is so stiff," says one, opening the top drawer of a file cabinet.  "Musta been a goddamn draft in my apartment last night."<br/><br/>"This office is too freakin’ cold," says another, typing.<br/><br/>"The weather outside is lousy," still another says.  <br/><br/>"If I was gonna be a widow, why not a rich one, so I wouldn’t have to work here."  <br/><br/>"Larry, that rice cake you gave me yesterday nearly broke my teeth."<br/><br/>"I hate that jerk in stat--the one who wears the paisley shirts.  Every time I see him, I wanna puke."  <br/><br/>And on and on.  <br/><br/>You sit down at your desk, discover your boss has already left a job for you--a 100–page handwritten report, half an inch thick.  The yellow post–it on top says, I want this typed by lunchtime.  <br/><br/>The person collecting Lotto money comes around.  Up to now you haven’t kicked in--you think Lotto is like happy hour and religion, opium to soothe the poor workers’ misery, to keep them numb and dreaming while keeping them in line.  Also, it would cut into money for writing materials you can’t steal from the supply room.  For each night, after work, you go straight home and grind out the next few pages of The Novel.  You are not a secretary, you are a novelist temporarily doing secretarial work, until The Big One sells and you retire with your laptop to the country.<br/><br/>As you sit there considering a Lotto share, a blue, toxic–smelling haze descends on you from the ceiling vent.  You and the Lotto person start to sneeze, your eyes begin to water.  The blue haze is everywhere, and the entire floor is in an uproar.  The Chief Honcho upstairs is called.  Angry to be disturbed from his meeting, he comes down.  He phones the maintenance men in the lobby, informs you and the others there is construction going on in the building.  They’re using PAN—not acetylene—torches to cut up two old elevator shafts.  PAN fumes, he assures you--looking at his watch--are in no way harmful to breathe.  <br/><br/>Two of the Hey–It’s–Only–A–Jobbers open their mouths to protest, but the Chief Honcho is gone.  Everyone goes back to their desks, coughing, tying handkerchiefs bandit–style around their mouths and noses.  In an effort to protect your eyes, you take the sunglasses from your bag and put them on.  You think about calling the Institute for Occupational Health and Safety, but remember that’s who you work for.  The Lotto person passes your desk and you grab him.  You fish two crumpled dollar bills from your pocket, buy two shares in the pool.<br/><br/>It’s beginning.  You’re becoming a full–fledged office worker.<br/><br/>Happy hour starts at five.  See you there.<br/>

        content: <div>
                        <p><span>MOM<br/><br/>	The old woman reading on the park bench doesn't look up.  But her worn brown overcoat seems familiar.<br/><br/>	"Ma?" he says.<br/><br/>	From beneath a fuzzy green ski cap, his mother looks up.  Her face is wrinkled and red, her eyes slightly bloodshot, and glassy from the cold.  She stares at him a moment, then smiles.<br/><br/>	"I can't believe you're doing this, Ma."<br/><br/>	Her face hardens.<br/><br/>	She eyes the familiar winter clothes he's wearing—her husband's baggy corduroys, her son Sean's bomber jacket—and her ruddy eyelids narrow.<br/><br/>	"If you're here," she says between clenched teeth, "to try and drag me home, better turn around.  Before I call a cop."<br/><br/>	He realizes it was a mistake to wear their clothes.  He steps back and throws up his hands.<br/><br/>	"No," he says.  "No, I just came to say hello."  <br/><br/>	He watches her face soften a bit, then asks if he can sit down.  She looks at him suspiciously.  Then she picks up the library book she laid face down on her lap, and resumes reading.  The Color Purple, the book is, by Alice Walker.  He hasn't read it, but he knows what it's about.  It's a far cry from the romance novels she read when he was young, after she washed and dried the dishes, wiped off the kitchen table, and put the younger kids to bed.<br/><br/>	He shoos a pigeon from the empty side of the bench, and with his hand inspects it.  Sitting, the cold rushes through his father's corduroys.  He forces himself to ignore it.<br/><br/>	"I would've come sooner, Ma," he says, "but I was having a rough time getting used to the city."<br/><br/>	Beside the trash can, two pigeons peck at scraps in an open box of Kentucky Fried Chicken.<br/><br/>	Remembering the culture shock he felt his first two days back, he laughs.  "I might not have survived if I tried coming yesterday."<br/><br/>	His mother turns the page, not looking at him, though he knows she's listening.  He wonders if it was a mistake to come.  He wonders whether he really wants her to live with him.<br/><br/>	"What do you have in the bags?" he asks.<br/><br/>	She looks at the two Woolworth's bags between her feet.  "An extra sweater," she says coolly.  "Some saltines . . . apples.  You want an apple?"<br/><br/>	While he wags his head indecisively, she lays her book on her lap, removes her mittens, and digs deeply into the bag nearest him.  Her red, chapped hands and wrinkled face smell like Jergens lotion.  A few strands of white hair stick out from under her ski hat.  It's amazing how much she's aged since he last saw her, and how quickly time has passed since he was young.  He wonders how long she'll survive living at the Vigilant.<br/><br/>	She holds out to him the least bruised of two badly bruised apples.<br/><br/>	"McIntosh," she says.  "Your favorite."<br/><br/>	He takes the cold apple, pleased she remembers.<br/><br/>	"It's half–priced fruit," she says, watching him eye the bruises.  "Just eat around the bad parts."<br/><br/>	He bites into a good part, picturing her rifling through a supermarket dumpster.  He shakes the picture away and takes another bite.  He wonders if they'll get along if she lives with them.  His life is already complicated.  Does he really want to throw her into the mix?<br/><br/>	It's all a little hard to believe, he thinks, stamping his foot and driving an encroaching pigeon away.  Here he is, in a playground in Manhattan, in the middle of winter, sitting beside the woman who used to do everything for him:  cut his meals into little chewable pieces, give him soothing tummy rubs when his stomach ached, shower him with healing kisses when he fell from his three–wheeler, or scraped his knee while playing.  And here she is living in a run–down SRO, surviving on meals at soup kitchens, on bruised fruit she scavenges from supermarket dumpsters.<br/><br/>	"When'd you get back?"<br/><br/>	"Sunday," he says, sitting up.  He watches her fold the corner of a page and close the book.  "Three days ago."<br/><br/>	"I know what day it is."<br/><br/>	He bounces his legs to keep warm.  "Sorry."<br/><br/>	"You're not used to this cold, are you?" she says.  "Los Angeles must be nice and warm."<br/><br/>	"Ma, what happened with you and Dad?  You want to talk about it?"<br/><br/>	She looks away, squinting into the sun.<br/><br/>	"You guys have a fight?"<br/><br/>	She laughs, then waves away the suggestion with her mittened hand.  She looks at the empty, sunlit handball courts, beyond which five lanes of cars, buses and trucks battle down Second Avenue.  "Your father wouldn't bother."  She laughs again.  "A fight?  Nah.  That would've taken too much effort."<br/><br/>	"Well he and everyone else send their love, Ma," he lies.  "They all miss you, you know.  We're all very worried about you."<br/><br/>	She frowns, looks him in the eye.  "I'm just an old, worn–out machine to them, Tommy.  An old black and white TV whose tubes don't work no more."<br/><br/>	He slides closer to her on the bench.  "Come on now, Ma.  That's not how anyone feels."<br/><br/>	"I've served my purpose," she says, squinting.  "Now I'm dirt."  She undoes the top button of her coat, and he sees she has on a second coat underneath.<br/><br/>	"Why don't we get a cup of coffee somewhere, Ma.  Someplace warm."<br/><br/>	Her face tightens.  "No, thank you," she says.  She opens the book to her place.  "I don't need any coffee."<br/><br/>	"Aren't you cold, Ma?" he says moments later.  "I'm freezing."<br/><br/>	She looks at his bare, purplish hands, then up at his uncovered head.<br/><br/>	"No hat and gloves?"<br/><br/>	He studies the laces on his right New Balance.  "Look, Ma—"<br/><br/>	"What'd you leave them home?"<br/><br/>	"I left them at Kevin's."<br/><br/>	"Boy–oh–boy, Tommy," she says with that familiar smile.  She takes off her ski hat and mittens, and hands them to him.  Her white hair is cropped short, and she's thinning on top.<br/><br/>	"Nah, it's all right," he says, pushing away the ski hat and mittens.  "I'm not that cold."<br/><br/>	"Go 'head, put them on, you'll catch your death of cold.  You're not used to this weather.  Go on, Tommy, take them."<br/><br/>	He takes the ski hat and mittens, and puts them on.<br/><br/>	"You ever read this book?" she says, holding up The Color Purple.<br/><br/>	He tells her he hasn't.<br/><br/>	"Boy, this woman's sharp."  She begins reading where she left off.  "One sharp cookie, this woman is."  She reads a sentence or two, then looks at him.  <br/><br/>"She knows what goes on between men and women.  And she ain't afraid to write it."<br/><br/>	He wipes his nose on the back of her mitten, opens and closes his hands, which are slightly numb.  He can't take this much longer.  Gradually, he brings his arm around the top of the bench, then around her shoulders.  He gives her shoulders the slightest pressure, just enough to make himself felt, but no more.  <br/><br/>	She tenses.<br/><br/>	After a few minutes, he feels her relax.  Then, in a loving voice, he asks if she'll come with him to LA, and—before she can refuse—if they can please go someplace warm, just to sit if that's all she wants.  He feels her stiffen.<br/><br/>	"I don't want to be anybody's burden," she says, turning from him, squinting into the sun.  "I'll get a job here.  I'll be all right.  Don't worry."<br/><br/>	He rocks his legs to warm himself.  "What if you don't find one?"<br/><br/>	"I'll find one."  She closes the book and rests it sideways on her lap.  "If not I'll get by on social security."<br/><br/>	Though he tries not to, he laughs.  "How much is that these days?"<br/><br/>	She looks at him sharply.  <br/><br/>	"Half your father's," she says. 	<br/><br/>	After a while, she digs into one of her bags, comes up with a worn black ski hat and pair of white mittens, and puts them on.  Then she turns to him.<br/><br/>	"Look, I don't want your pity, Tommy.  I'll get by.  Always have.  Always will.  Don't worry about it."<br/><br/>	"What if you don't find a job?"<br/><br/>	She sighs and looks across the park.  "I will."<br/><br/>	"Have you started looking?"<br/><br/>	"A little," she says, though from the way she says it, he senses she's actually looked a lot.  "Here and there."<br/><br/>	"And?"<br/><br/>	"Nothing yet," she says, looking at Second Avenue.  "Not many people want to hire a sixty–seven–year–old woman who lives at the Vigilant."  She turns to him.  "Look, can we talk about something else?"  She scratches the tip of her nose with her mitten.  "How's Lynn and Jacob?  You and Lynn pick out a school yet for him?"<br/><br/>	"Do you have to tell them where you live?"<br/><br/>	She rolls her eyes.  "They gotta have someplace to call to tell me I got the job."<br/><br/>	"Well . . . can't you arrange with the guy at the desk?  For him not to answer the phone with 'Vigilant'?"<br/><br/>	She smiles patiently.  "A woman named Irmine works the desk.  Jamaican.  Very nice.  But she's got a hundred and twenty residents.  The owner says she's gotta answer 'Vigilant.'  What's she gonna do, lose her job over me?"  She looks at her brown rubber boots, then at the Second Avenue traffic.  "Don't worry, something'll come along.  Always has.  Always will.  Don't pity me, Tommy.  I don't want your pity."<br/><br/>	"Apartments are cheaper out there, Ma.  Me and Lynn live in an expensive area, but there's cheaper spots around.  We could find you something you could afford.  Lynn's brother's in rentals.  We could put you up until he found you something."<br/><br/>	At that her shoulders relax a bit, and he rubs them a little harder, his hand thawing slightly inside her mitten.<br/><br/>	"Look, it's my turn now.  I'll take care of you."<br/><br/>	"I don't need anybody to take care of me.  I can take care of myself."<br/><br/>	"All right.  But at least let me help.  Can't I help?"<br/><br/>	A dapper old man and his well–groomed afghan enter through the opposite gate.  The afghan runs over and sniffs at Dan's crotch, then sprints to its owner.<br/><br/>	"I don't need anybody's help," she says, watching the old man leash the afghan near the water fountain.  "I don't need anybody to take care of me.  No thanks."<br/><br/>	"No one's going to take care of you.  We just want to help a little, that's all."<br/><br/>	His mother sighs.  She fishes out a slice of stale rye bread from a plastic bag in her coat pocket, pitches it to the pigeons milling around the trash can.<br/><br/>	"Is it because of Lynn?"<br/><br/>	"Whaddyamean?"<br/><br/>	"That she's Jewish?"<br/><br/>	She purses her lips, then looks at him.  "Jewish, smooish, what's it matter?  As long as you love her, and she loves you."  She coos to the brown pigeon with white tail feathers bobbing toward her, and drops it a scrap of bread.  "Look at me and your father.  We're both Catholic.  Irish.  What good it'd do?  As long as you love her, and she loves you.  That's what counts."  She tosses another slice to the pigeons coming toward her.  "You kids're all grown now.  Independent.  I don't want to burden you.  You got your own lives."<br/><br/>	But he can see her heart isn't in it.  And after a while of watching three teenagers terrorize the Second Avenue traffic, he says, "Remember that old Horn and Hardarts, Ma?  Near Radio City?  The one we used to eat at after the Easter show?"  Her small smile tells him she does.  And after invoking a few more memories, and picking at another of her bruised apples, she agrees to go there for one cup of hot chocolate.<br/><br/>	On the way to the subway, she asks how the others are.  He tells her all he knows, about Kevin's decision to sell his medallions and just run his gas station.  She thinks it's a good idea.<br/><br/>	"It's amazing how far we've come," he says.  He thinks of the old apartment, he and Sean and Kevin in one bedroom, Sue, Katey and Meg in the other, she and Dad sleeping in the living room on the convertible couch.<br/><br/>	"Yeah," she says smiling.  "I'm very proud of all of you.  I know your father is, too."<br/><br/>	She lets him take her bags as they pass the Häagen–Dazs at Third Avenue.	<br/><br/>	"I see you're getting a little gray, Tommy," she says.  "Ain't it something how time flies?"  She reaches up and tugs his earlobe.  "How's it feel to be an old fart, heh, Tommy–boy?"<br/><br/>	"You know, Ma, you'd really like it.  No more New York winters, no more snow."<br/><br/>	"Ain't there a lot of smog, Tommy?"<br/><br/>	"We're by the beach, Ma.  The smog's inland."  <br/><br/>	"Yeah?"  She steps aside to let two young professionals in a hurry pass, her face brightening.  "Much of a breeze out there?"<br/><br/>	"Sure," he says, and he improvises about the "year–round trade winds" that blow off the Pacific.<br/><br/>	"And mild," he adds half a block later, knowing her penchant for moderation.  "It's got four seasons, but mild seasons.  Not too warm, not too cold.  Just nice."<br/><br/>	She says nothing, but he knows it's a good sign.  He figures she's already imagining herself cruising around sunny Southern California, in a bright little VW convertible.  With no husband to serve or answer to, and finally doing what she pleases, perhaps broadening her horizons with some college.<br/><br/>	At the Sixth Avenue station, the attendant in the token booth looks at him funny, and he realizes he and his mother are a sight, he in his worn green ski hat, oversize bomber jacket and baggy pants, and his mother, this shabbily dressed woman who might easily live on the street.  But he shrugs off the attendant's look, and the subtle stares from the well–dressed couple on the platform, and he thinks ahead to his next move.<br/><br/>	When he gets back to his father's place, with a firm promise to meet her again tomorrow, he'll call the others about setting up a monthly fund, until she gets on her feet financially.  It's only fair they share the cost of her upkeep.  But perhaps she'd be happier living with Kevin and Nancy, in their big house in Roslyn.  She might be better off staying here, and Kevin's kids would be good for her.  LA would be a drastic change.  At her age it might be too difficult to adjust.  Their house has only two bedrooms, which he and Lynn felt were enough for them and Jacob, but which would be a bit tight with a guest.  Surely his mother wouldn't want to share a bedroom with a four–year–old.  But he knows they'll work something out.  The important thing is that she have a home.<br/><br/>	He leans against the I–beam near where his mother sits, and smells the odor–free platform, studies the new fluorescent lights overhead.  He looks down at the track, at the spotless, freshly swept dirt floor between the rails.  He pulls out his wallet and counts his traveler's checks.  There are ten twenties and a fifty left.  He tries picturing the area around Radio City, but can't, and he realizes the old Horn & Hardarts was probably torn down long ago, replaced by some chic ethnic restaurant, some expensive place like the one Kevin took them to.  He wonders where they can go instead.<br/><br/>	When he hears the familiar roar from the tunnel, he takes his mother's arm.  The corrugated–steel B train screeches to a halt.  He picks up his mother's bags with one hand, and with the other guides her safely into the warm car.  It's not as spotless and shiny as the new stainless–steel four cars he saw at Grand Central, but the car's more modern than the ones on the Flushing line.<br/><br/>	"Nice and warm, isn't it?" he says, as he enjoys the heat, the relative smoothness of the ride.  She nods and smiles, and squeezes his forearm.  Otherwise, as the train moves sluggishly uptown, she sits in silence, still wearing her black ski hat and mittens, her feet crossed contentedly beneath her.  She'll be just fine, he thinks, shifting away to give her more room.  She'll be just fine.<br/><br/>	"I think that Horn and Hardarts is on Forty–sixth, Tommy," his mother says, as the train speeds into Forty–second Street.  "We should get off at Rockefeller Plaza, the next stop."<br/><br/>	He nods.<br/><br/>	She chuckles.  "That is, if it's still there.  They probably tore it down long ago.  We'll probably have to go someplace else."<br/><br/>	"That's all right."<br/><br/>	"You know, hon," she says as the doors close, "I'd insist on paying you back whatever you lay out for me.  Rent, food, whatever.  I don't want any handouts.  As soon as I get a job I'll pay you right back."  She removes her mittens and rubs her red, chapped hands.  "And as soon as I get a job I'll be right out and into my own little place.  You and Lynn got your own life."<br/><br/>	"Sure.  However you want to work it."<br/><br/>	Opposite them sits a woman Lynn's age, deep in thought, and as he studies her reflective face, he wonders if Lynn will go along with this.  He should've asked her before offering his mother what he has.  Lynn doesn't like living with lots of people.  She was raised in comfort, and likes her privacy and space.  Their two–bedroom house is small, and with his mother it might be uncomfortable.  For all of them.<br/><br/>	He feels guilty for his thought, but catches sight of an African woman and her son, a handsome boy of ten or eleven, at the end of the car.<br/><br/>	Watching mother and son, he remembers his mother's breakdown, which she had when he was eleven.  She convinced herself she was going to die.  She even insisted on writing her will, and on seeing Father Hanratty for her last rites.  And one morning, as he ate breakfast, with an awful gleam in her eye, as if she were punishing him for her bondage as housewife and mother, she told him she wanted him to be a good boy after she died.  And he cried and cried, and had bad dreams for months, even after she returned from the hospital.  What if she started with that crap again, in front of Jacob?  He might be better off putting her in a home, where she'd be with people with whom she shares common interests and memories.  They could find one near them, visit her every Sunday, take her on picnics to the beach.
