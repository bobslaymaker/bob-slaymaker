        content: <div><p><span>FLIGHT<br/><br/>“It’s about time you wore something made for a woman,” Kelly whispers, almost to herself, but loud enough for me to hear. <br/><br/>	Kelly’s holding the crimson teddy against my chest, the teddy Steve’s given me for Christmas. It’s shiny and silk, the first piece of lingerie anyone’s ever given me.<br/><br/>	Kelly notices my cheeks burning and touches my shoulder. <br/><br/>	“I’m sorry,” she says. “Really. I don’t know what makes me say things like that.”<br/><br/>	Because they’re true, I tell myself. Because they’re true.<br/><br/>	“How much do you think he paid for it,” I ask, moving away from her. I sit on her and John’s bed.<br/><br/>	“Oh, I’m sorry, Stace,” she says, and comes over and hugs me. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean it when I say things like that. Really.”<br/><br/>	I return her hug, then lie back on the sky–blue bedspread. I cover my face with one of her and John’s pillows.<br/><br/>	“So, anyway,” I say, taking the pillow off. “How much do you think he paid for it? The label says it’s silk.”<br/><br/>	Kelly holds the teddy against her, and looks in the mirror on the closet door. It looks so good on her, her womanly breasts pushing up beneath the teddy’s shiny silk. I wonder if I’ll fill it, if I’ll even wear it. I think of giving it to her.<br/><br/>	She runs over excitedly and sits beside me on the bed.<br/><br/>	“This is what’ll happen when he sees you in it,” she says. She goes to the dresser, strips off her jeans, blouse and bra, then puts on the teddy, and a pair of black lace stockings. She gets her green knit dress from the closet, and puts that on.<br/><br/>	She comes back to where I’m lying.<br/><br/>	“First,” she says, sitting on the bed and crossing her legs, “First, he’ll come over and kiss you. He’ll say you look great in your dress.”  <br/><br/>	She smoothes back her long brown hair, laughs, then smiles at me, and looks in the mirror. <br/><br/>	“Then, then he’ll kiss you again, and you’ll kiss him back, a long kiss, delicate, but only a little tongue, and only toward the end, very delicate, very light. He’ll run his tongue lightly over your lips.”<br/><br/>	“And he’ll kneel down in front of you. And gently, very gently, he’ll run his hand up your foot, slowly, very slowly, then up your calf, his hand soft and loving, moving very slowly.”<br/><br/>	“And his hand moves up the bottom of your thigh, till he gets to where there’s no stocking. And he touches your skin, and moves his hand around, to where the garter is. And as he touches it, he lets out a sweet little rush of air, ahhh.”<br/><br/>	Kelly stands up. She touches my shoulder and laughs. “And that’s how it’ll happen,” she says, smiling. She goes to the dresser, gathers up her clothes, and disappears into the bathroom.<br/><br/>	“That’s just how it’ll happen,” she shouts. “Just like that.”<br/><br/>	I know it won’t. But I take the teddy anyway, wrapped as Steve’s given it to me, in its gold box and fancy red ribbon. Getting on the bus at Kelly’s corner, I realize she doesn’t need it. Good things happen to her anyway, without teddies and garters, and lace stockings.<br/><br/>	When I get home, my mother tells me Steve’s called.<br/><br/>	“Steve? That you?”  I enter the bathroom, and sit on the toilet lid. He says he wants us to bring in the new year quietly. His parents are going hunting, and we’ll have the whole place to ourselves.<br/><br/> 
	“No party?” I say.<br/><br/>	“A party of two,” he says. “A party of two and some romance.”<br/><br/>	“You mean screwing,” I say, sort of sharp, though I don’t mean it. We haven’t slept together, but there’s something different about him, something tender.<br/><br/>	“No,” he says in a serious voice. “Lovemaking.”<br/><br/>	“What should I wear?” I ask softly. I sit back against the tank and wait for him to answer.<br/><br/>	“Whatever you like,” he says, and yawns. He clears his throat sleepily. “Wear whatever you like. There’ll be nobody here. You don’t have to impress anyone.”<br/><br/>	I hang up on him. He’s forgotten about the teddy. He probably didn’t even buy it himself—his sister probably picked it out and wrapped it for him.<br/><br/>	In the mirror, it’s worse than I expected. I’ve always been more or less flat–chested, but in the teddy it’s ridiculous. I cry, the tears streaking down the shiny crimson silk. I’ll give the teddy to Kelly. It’s made for her; she’s got breasts and hips, not me. I’ll wear my usual sleeping–together number, my Pearl Jam T–shirt, and my brightest white panties. The guys I’ve been with have always seemed to enjoy that, to respond to that. At least, that’s the way it’s always seemed.<br/><br/>	Sitting by the fire New Year’s Eve, I watch Steve rise from the couch, then kneel on the carpet in front of me. I sit up a bit, my legs feeling cool, awkwardly naked.<br/><br/>	I breathe in and hold my breath to make my breasts fill the dress. But I feel it hanging off me, the cups half–empty. Out of the corner of my eye, I see him secretly checking me out, his glance taking in my non–existent breasts, my non–existent hips. He must be very disappointed, I think, closing my eyes. I fight the urge to run home and change into baggy jeans and a loose flannel shirt.<br/><br/>	Kneeling on the floor, he touches the hem of my dress, and caresses the soft cotton. Then he takes off my pumps.<br/><br/>	“You look really good tonight,” he says, smiling.<br/><br/>	“You don’t look so bad yourself,” I manage, voice cracking.<br/><br/>	He rises on his knees and kisses me. I kiss him back, and he runs his tongue over my lips, lightly, very delicately.<br/><br/>	I remember what Kelly said.<br/><br/>	He drops back down, and puts his hand on my foot. Softly, slowly, he runs his hand up my calf, then onto my knee, stopping to fondle it. I’m getting excited, but I don’t breathe, don’t move, and his hand glides smoothly up the bottom of my thigh, fingering the lace stocking. <br/><br/> When he gets to where the stocking ends, he stops. I watch him smile. His fingers find my garter, and he lets out a sweet little rush of air, ahhh, just like Kelly said he would. And I see Kelly’s face, and beside it John’s. Then their faces disappear, and it’s just me and Steve, me holding him by the fire, kissing him, loving him, rising like any other woman toward the sky.

                        <p><span>OH, LOTTO GOD, DELIVER US FROM MISERY<br/><br/>You get up at seven, wash, iron a shirt, stuff something down—an apple, a banana, anything—then rush to the train to try and get a seat. <br/><br/>You get to the station late and have to stand all the way to the city. <br/><br/>At the office, you pass the Hey–It’s–Only–A–Jobbers talking at their desks. <br/><br/>They’re bright and cheery, but you walk on to the department in the far corner, where you work with the This–Office–Is–My–Lifers, who are already complaining.<br/><br/>“My neck is so stiff,” says one, opening the top drawer of a file cabinet. “Musta been a goddamn draft in my apartment last night.”<br/><br/>“This office is too freakin’ cold,” says another, typing.<br/><br/>“The weather outside is <i>lousy</i>,” still another says. <br/><br/>“If I was gonna be a widow, why not a rich one, so I wouldn’t have to work here.”  <br/><br/>“Larry, that rice cake you gave me yesterday nearly broke my teeth.”<br/><br/>“I hate that jerk in stat—the one who wears the paisley shirts. Every time I see him, I wanna puke.”  <br/><br/>And on and on. <br/><br/>You sit down at your desk, discover your boss has already left a job for you—a 100–page handwritten report, half an inch thick. <br/><br/>The yellow post–it on top says, <i>I want this typed by lunchtime</i>. <br/><br/>The person collecting Lotto money comes around. <br/><br/>Up to now you haven’t kicked in—you think Lotto is like happy hour and religion, opium to soothe the poor workers’ misery, to keep them numb and dreaming while keeping them in line. <br/><br/>Also, it would cut into money for writing materials you can’t steal from the supply room. <br/><br/>For each night, after work, you go straight home and grind out the next few pages of The Novel. <br/><br/>You are not a secretary, you are a novelist temporarily doing secretarial work, until The Big One sells and you retire with your laptop to the country.<br/><br/>As you sit there considering a Lotto share, a blue, toxic–smelling haze descends on you from the ceiling vent. <br/><br/>You and the Lotto person start to sneeze, your eyes begin to water. <br/><br/>The blue haze is everywhere, and the entire floor is in an uproar. <br/><br/>The Head Honcho upstairs is called. <br/><br/>Angry to be disturbed from his meeting, he comes down. <br/><br/>He phones the maintenance men in the lobby, informs you and the others there’s construction going on in the building. <br/><br/>They’re using PAN—<i>not acetylene</i>—torches to cut up two old elevator shafts. <br/><br/>PAN fumes, he assures you—looking at his watch—are in no way harmful to breathe. <br/><br/>Two of the Hey–It’s–Only–A–Jobbers open their mouths to protest, but the Head Honcho’s gone. <br/><br/>Everyone goes back to their desks, coughing, tying handkerchiefs bandit–style around their mouths and noses. <br/><br/>In an effort to protect your eyes, you take the sunglasses from your bag and put them on. <br/><br/>You think about calling the Institute for Occupational Health and Safety, but remember that’s who you work for. <br/><br/>The Lotto person passes your desk and you grab him. <br/><br/>You fish two crumpled dollar bills from your pocket, buy two shares in the pool.<br/><br/>It’s beginning. You’re becoming a full–fledged office worker.<br/><br/>Happy hour starts at five. See you there.<br/><br/><br/>
