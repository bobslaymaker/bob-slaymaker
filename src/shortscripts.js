              EXT. CITY PARK – DAY (WINTER)<div className="spacer"></div>A light layer of snow covers the deserted park. Bare trees line the main path. Skyscrapers stand in the background.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. OFFICE BUILDING – LOBBY – 8:55 AM<div className="spacer"></div>Several PEOPLE wait for the elevator to take them to their jobs. Among them is starving artist SAM BROCK, 26, a working–class white guy. Not looking forward to eight hours at his day job, he pens some changes to a poem.<div className="spacer"></div>JAE SMITH, 24, black, arrives. Raised in the projects, Jae’s a ballerina and, like Sam, doesn’t seem too enthused about heading to her day job. Instead she practices the five foot positions.<div className="spacer"></div>Jae’s clothes are a bit worn, but she has a pleasant, calm demeanor.<div className="spacer"></div>Nervous and shy, Sam glances indirectly at Jae. Receptive, she looks straight at him.<div className="spacer"></div>He averts his eyes, walks around a bit, taps the wall anxiously with his shoe.<div className="spacer"></div>The elevator comes and everyone gets on.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR CAR – CONTINUOUS<div className="spacer"></div>Nobody looks at anyone else.<div className="spacer"></div>Sam secretly watches Jae get off on the third floor. She heads for her job’s double doors.<div className="spacer"></div>On the fifth floor, Sam exits, makes his way to the office where he works.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR BANK – 8:55 AM (ANOTHER DAY)<div className="spacer"></div>Sam joins the others, minus Jae, who's not there.<div className="spacer"></div>Sam subtly scans the lobby for Jae, including the building’s entrance.<div className="spacer"></div>Not seeing her, he unhappily taps the wall with his shoe.<div className="spacer"></div>The elevator arrives. He again surveys the lobby and entrance for Jae, but there's no sign of her.<div className="spacer"></div>Disappointed, he enters the elevator. The doors close.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR BANK – 8:55 AM (ANOTHER DAY)<div className="spacer"></div>The gang’s all here—except for Sam.<div className="spacer"></div>When the elevator doors open, Jae holds them, quickly checks the building’s entrance, hoping to see Sam enter. But he doesn’t. Noting a MALE PASSENGER’s annoyed look, she lets go of the doors, joins the others inside.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR BANK – 8:55 AM (ANOTHER DAY)<div className="spacer"></div>The usual group/small crowd, including Jae and Sam, gets ready to be transported to work. <div className="spacer"></div>Sam finds the courage to talk to Jae.<div className="spacer"></div>SAM<br/>(nervous, awkward)<br/>Do you know what time it is? <div className="spacer"></div>Jae points, somewhat humorously, but also affectionately, at the phone Sam holds, which, like all phones, displays the time.<div className="spacer"></div>Sam, embarrassed by his pathetic attempt to start a conversation, vows to never try talking to her again.<div className="spacer"></div>A MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR  joins the small crowd. When the elevator arrives, Jae and Sam hold the opposing doors, and the Man in the Wheelchair wheels himself in.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR CAR – CONTINUOUS<div className="spacer"></div>Standing on either side of the Man in the Wheelchair, Jae and Sam exchange looks—Sam’s shy and brief, Jae’s forward and sustained. Neither speaks. Sam watches Jae depart at the third floor.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. CITY PARK – DAY (SPRING)<div className="spacer"></div>The trees are budding. People walking on the main path wear light jackets.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR BANK – 8:55 AM (ANOTHER DAY)<div className="spacer"></div>Jae and several others await the elevator. Sam’s nowhere to be seen.<div className="spacer"></div>The elevator’s on the tenth floor, so Jae quickly walks around the lobby, looking for Sam.<div className="spacer"></div>But he’s nowhere in sight.<div className="spacer"></div>Back at the elevator, Jae holds the doors, checks the building’s entrance. Still no Sam.<div className="spacer"></div>MALE PASSENGER<br/>(irritated)<br/>Come on, some of us need to get to work. You’ll see whoever it is later.<div className="spacer"></div>Jae lets go of the doors, boards the elevator. [feeling sad she didn’t help him talk to her]<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR BANK – 8:55 AM (ANOTHER DAY)<div className="spacer"></div>As Sam waits for the elevator, he’s joined by only one other person. And that person is not Jae.<div className="spacer"></div>With the elevator on the twelfth floor, Sam quickly tours the lobby, discreetly looking for Jae.<div className="spacer"></div>He returns empty–handed, angry at himself for not seizing his previous opportunities to connect with her.<div className="spacer"></div>Entering the car, he sadly realizes he may never see her again.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. CITY PARK – DAY (SUMMER)<div className="spacer"></div>A beautiful sunny day.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR BANK – 8:55 AM (ANOTHER DAY)<div className="spacer"></div>Jae waits with the others. There’s no Sam.<div className="spacer"></div>The elevator reaches the ground floor. The doors open.<div className="spacer"></div>A middle–age woman idly taps the wall with her foot in the same way Sam used to.<div className="spacer"></div>Jae, reminded of Sam, glances at the front doors, is surprised to see Sam enter.<div className="spacer"></div>Jae thrusts her arm between the closing elevator doors, and they re–open.<div className="spacer"></div>She holds the doors, and waves at Sam.<div className="spacer"></div>He sees her and hurries.<div className="spacer"></div>MALE PASSENGER<br/><i>LET GO OF THE DOORS!</i><div className="spacer"></div>Sam and Jae enter the elevator together.<div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>(to Male Passenger)<br/>Sorry. <div className="spacer"></div>Male Passenger frowns angrily. The elevator starts upward.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. ELEVATOR CAR – CONTINUOUS<div className="spacer"></div>Sam looks indirectly at Jae.<div className="spacer"></div>SAM<br/>(whispering)<br/>Thanks. <div className="spacer"></div>Then he looks away.<div className="spacer"></div>Jae knows how shy and self–conscious Sam is, so she whispers back:<div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>You’re welcome. <div className="spacer"></div>Only a few moments remain till they arrive at her floor.<div className="spacer"></div>But Sam can’t meet her gaze, or get out any words.<div className="spacer"></div>The elevator stops on the third floor.<div className="spacer"></div>Jae smiles at him.<div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>(hopeful, supportive)<br/>This is my stop. <div className="spacer"></div>She waits as long as she can for Sam to do something, then exits the car.<div className="spacer"></div>Sam stands frozen in place.<div className="spacer"></div>As the doors are about to shut, Sam throws his arm between them, jumps off.<div className="spacer"></div>MALE PASSENGER<br/>(fed up)<br/>My god—get a room! <div className="spacer"></div>The doors re–close. The elevator ascends.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. THIRD–FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK – CONTINUOUS<div className="spacer"></div>Sam stands there, tongue–tied, still unable to look straight at Jae, or speak.<div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>(encouragingly)<br/>It’s good to see you.<div className="spacer"></div>SAM<br/>(jabbering nervously)<br/>My agency sent me out of town for another assignment—the few times I was back here they mostly put me on the night shift.<div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>(calmly)<br/>What kind of work do you do? <div className="spacer"></div> SAM<br/>I’m a writer slash word processor.<div className="spacer"></div> JAE<br/>(smiling)<br/>Dancer slash assistant. <div className="spacer"></div> SAM<br/>(beating himself up)<br/>I should have tried to find you. <div className="spacer"></div> JAE<br/>(supportively)<br/>It’s okay, you’re here now.<br/>(extends her hand)<br/>I’m Jae. <div className="spacer"></div>SAM<br/> (shaking her hand)<br/>S–S–S–am.<div className="spacer"></div>Jae smiles.<div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>(gentle, warm)<br/>S–S–S–am? <div className="spacer"></div>SAM<br/>I’m nervous. <div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>Don’t be. I don’t bite. <div className="spacer"></div> She feigns a playful bite in his direction. Jae’s affectionate lightheartedness makes him a bit less nervous. He smiles, and for the first time, at least for a moment, he locks eyes with her, before averting his gaze. <div className="spacer"></div>SAM<br/>(moment of truth)<br/>Can I walk you to your office? <div className="spacer"></div>JAE<br/>Sure. <div className="spacer"></div>Jae and Sam head to her job’s double doors.<div className="spacer"></div>We slowly pull back, beyond earshot, as Sam anxiously takes out his phone.<div className="spacer"></div>Though we can’t hear them, we see him ask for her number.<div className="spacer"></div>She gives it to him, and he puts it in his contacts.<div className="spacer"></div>He thanks her, heads back to catch the next elevator.<div className="spacer"></div>He glances behind him, sees her looking at him.<div className="spacer"></div>She smiles warmly.<div className="spacer"></div>He presses the elevator button, finally fully relaxed, beaming brightly. <div className="spacer"></div><u><center>THE END</center></u><div className="spacer"></div>

It’s a whole different world here.<div className="spacer"></div>LUNA<br/>It’s pretty.<div className="spacer"></div>LATER<div className="spacer"></div>Luna and Alex turn onto a block of identical ranch houses.<div className="spacer"></div>In the front yard of the first house, LOUIE VALENTINO, 50, spots them, abruptly stops landscaping.<div className="spacer"></div>ALEX<br/>(neighborly)<br/>Hi, Louie!<div className="spacer"></div>As Alex and Luna pass, Louie glares at them with deep–seated hate.<div className="spacer"></div>It takes Alex a few moments to realize the problem.<div className="spacer"></div>He keeps walking Luna up the block.<div className="spacer"></div>ALEX<br/>I forgot what it’s like here. Good thing I met you at the bus stop.<div className="spacer"></div>Luna doesn’t say anything.<div className="spacer"></div>Alex turns them onto the walkway leading to his parents’ front door.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. POOR URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>The neighborhood is undergoing gentrification.

Luna and Alex keep walking, but unconsciously disengage.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. QUIET, LEAFY SUBURB 2 – STRIP MALL – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Luna and Alex hold hands as they window–shop. Luna, clearly the only black person for miles, wears a beret. <div className="spacer"></div>A group of eight white teenagers—three GIRLS, five BOYS—approach them.<div className="spacer"></div>BOY 1<br/>Since when do they allow niggers here!?<div className="spacer"></div>One GIRL snatches Luna’s beret.<div className="spacer"></div>Alex steps toward the Girl, but the Teens are too many, and eager to beat them unconscious. <div className="spacer"></div>TEENS<br/>...Don’t put that hat on, it’s got nigger on it...Let’s find a noose and a tree and string this nigger bitch up...<br/>(to Luna)<br/>...Go back to fuckin’ Zululand...<br/>(to Alex)<br/>...Fuckin’ race traitor!...<div className="spacer"></div>The Teens inch closer.<div className="spacer"></div>As they’re about to pounce, Alex shoves Luna into the shoe store beside them. He darts inside and pulls the door shut.<div className="spacer"></div>The Teens stand inches from the store window, snarling insults and threats:<div className="spacer"></div>TEENS<br/>...Nigger bitch!...Get some rope!...We’re gonna lynch your ass!...Fuckin’ baboon!...<div className="spacer"></div>Boy 2 starts to open the door, but stops when he sees the STORE MANAGER dialing 911.<div className="spacer"></div>Boy 2 points to Alex, Luna and the Store Manager.<div className="spacer"></div>BOY 2<br/>We’ll be back for all three of you!<div className="spacer"></div>Having “defended” their neighborhood, the Teens proudly, confidently saunter away. <div className="spacer"></div>EXT. POOR URBAN NEIGHBORHOOD – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>As Luna and Alex stroll, she takes his arm.<div className="spacer"></div>A black HOMELESS MAN, gray–haired, but tall and wiry, walks in the opposite direction.<div className="spacer"></div>As the Homeless Man passes Luna, he bumps her shoulder hard.<div className="spacer"></div>Alex angrily turns to the Man. The Man’s ready to go, fists up like a boxer, eyes narrowed with hate.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN<br/>Go for it! <i>GO FOR IT!</i><div className="spacer"></div>Alex glares at the Man. Luna tries pulling Alex away.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN<br/>(inching closer)<br/><i>C’mon, boy!

She stares straight ahead, not looking at anyone, not wanting trouble. <div className="spacer"></div>At the bus stop she removes a book from her bag, and starts reading it, eyes glued to the page.<div className="spacer"></div>Alex watches the Black Woman for a while. Then he looks back at his wife, Jimmy and Sharon talking.<div className="spacer"></div>Deep in thought, he no longer hears what they’re saying.<div className="spacer"></div>Eying the Black Woman alone at the bus stop, afraid to look at anyone, he’s filled with sadness and remorse.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT.

         EXT. DIVERSE, WORKING–POOR NEIGHBORHOOD – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE, white, mid–twenties, medium height and weight, walks down a block of well–worn townhouse rentals. He passes three cheap beach chairs sitting in Townhouse #12’s small yard. Then he unlocks the door to Townhouse #16.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. DAVE AND KEISHA’S TOWNHOUSE (#16) – VARIOUS – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Dave makes his way through the half–unpacked boxes in the sparsely furnished living room. He climbs the stairs to the second floor, enters his and his wife’s bedroom.<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA, black, also mid–twenties, lies awake on the queen–size mattress on the floor. She seems upset.<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>Hi.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>What’s wrong?<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>The woman in #8 was sitting on the curb with a bloody hand. I called an ambulance. I think the guy she lives with beat her. She must have fallen on broken glass or something while he was hitting her.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave winces at the thought of a woman being beaten.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>The guy was out there with her?<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>No, probably inside.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>The ambulance took her away?<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>(shakes head)<br/>She told them she fell. They just bandaged her and left.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave stares at her, still cringing.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>Who’s the guy she lives with?<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>The big burly guy.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>Big burly guy?<br/>(racking his brain)<br/> Young?<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>No, not young.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>An old guy?<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>Not that old. Around thirty–three, thirty–four.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave stands there, still processing this awful news. <div className="spacer"></div>Then he tries moving their day forward.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>I’m going to clean out that closet.<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA<br/>Need help?<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>No. You worked late. Sleep.<div className="spacer"></div>As Keisha goes back to sleep, Dave descends the stairs. He opens the closet full of junk the previous tenants left.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. DAVE AND KEISHA’S TOWNHOUSE (#16) – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Dave carries an old vacuum cleaner and portable heater to the curb. <div className="spacer"></div>He can’t help but stare when LARRY, the big burly guy, mid–thirties, steps out of Townhouse #8 with the submissive woman he lives with, ROSE. Rose lugs a folded shopping cart, which she leans against the side of the building. She’s short, slender, also in her mid–thirties, and has long black hair and a heavily bandaged hand.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave coils and uncoils the vacuum and heater cords, sneaking peeks at Larry and Rose.<div className="spacer"></div>Larry ignores Dave pretending not to look at them. Larry’s about Dave’s height, but at least sixty pounds heavier. He’s got a bit of a belly, but his shoulders and arms are thick—like a cement worker, garbage man or wrestler. <div className="spacer"></div>Having locked the door, Rose puts the keys in her bag. Larry searches his pockets, can’t find what he’s looking for. <div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>(angry)<br/>Get my wallet. Or you’ll be buying your own groceries, stupid. <div className="spacer"></div>Rose meekly unlocks the door, enters their townhouse. <div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>(shouting into house)<br/>Hurry the fuck up!<div className="spacer"></div>Larry busies himself with his phone.<div className="spacer"></div>Still fiddling with the vacuum and heater cords, Dave secretly studies Larry. <div className="spacer"></div>Rose steps out with Larry’s wallet and locks the door. Larry grabs the wallet from her, opens it.<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>The money, moron. You didn’t bring my money. Check the dresser. What the fuck do I have to do to get you to use your brain?  <div className="spacer"></div>Larry slaps the side of her head hard. Rose moves slightly away from him.<div className="spacer"></div>ROSE<br/>(whiny)<br/>C’mon, Larry...<div className="spacer"></div>Dave wants to say something, but is too scared.<div className="spacer"></div>Finally, he gathers his courage, advances a few steps to the near edge of Townhouse #12’s lawn.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>(voice trembling)<br/>Why don’t you leave her alone, you bully. <div className="spacer"></div>When Larry comes to the lawn’s far edge, Dave stands firm. But he swallows hard.<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>(menacing)<br/>Was I talking to you, asshole? Mind your fuckin’ business.<div className="spacer"></div>Larry’s trunk and arms are much bigger up close.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave hesitates a good while.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>(scared shitless)<br/>Beating a woman’s everyone’s business.<div className="spacer"></div>Enraged, Larry charges Dave and quickly gets him in a headlock. Rose grabs Larry’s arm, trying to free Dave. Incensed, Larry wheels around and starts slapping Rose. <div className="spacer"></div>She falls to the grass, and Larry straddles her, knees in her armpits. He keeps slapping her.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave jumps on Larry’s back, gets his arm around Larry’s neck. He tries with all his might to pull Larry off her. But Larry’s a bull—Dave can’t budge him. Larry continues slapping Rose, whose nose has begun to bleed.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave hears behind him heavy footsteps and the SHRILL SHRIEKING of women.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE, a large Latina woman in jeans and yellow kerchief, arms as thick as Larry’s, runs up and punches Larry in the eye—Larry’s head snaps back from the impact. <div className="spacer"></div>JING’s a short, skinny Asian woman wearing a red dress and matching spiked heels. She hammers Larry in the forehead with one of her heel spikes, drawing blood. <div className="spacer"></div>Dave's no longer needed. He watches Lupe, Jing, FLO (white, as large as Lupe), and AKIRA (medium–size, black) punch, heel–spike and wrestle Larry to the grass.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave kneels on the ground, catching his breath, as the four Women hold Larry down.<div className="spacer"></div>A passing straight COUPLE holding hands stops.<div className="spacer"></div>WOMAN<br/>(outraged)<br/>Violence is not the answer!<div className="spacer"></div>AKIRA<br/>(threatening)<br/>Fuck off!<div className="spacer"></div>Taken aback, the Couple silently moves on.<div className="spacer"></div>Larry breaks free and runs across the street. He stands on the opposite sidewalk, panting, wiping the blood from his face. <div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>Fuckin’ cunts! <div className="spacer"></div>JING<br/>We warned you, motherfucker! You’re out of here!<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>Fuck you!<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 1 and 2 exit their townhouses to watch the action. They drop into two of the beach chairs in Townhouse #12’s yard. Dave joins them in the third beach chair.<div className="spacer"></div>Lupe picks up Larry’s phone, wallet and cash, which fell from his pockets during the struggle. She sets them under the folded shopping cart, away from foot traffic.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>We’re packing your shit, Larry. Get your cab money ready.<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>I ain’t going nowhere. It’s my house.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>Not any more. Rose, open the door.<div className="spacer"></div>ROSE<br/>It’s okay. Forget it. I’ll be all right.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>The hell you will. Give me the keys, Rose. I’m not asking. This is for your own good.<div className="spacer"></div>Rose reluctantly hands her keys to Lupe, who opens the door.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(to Flo and Akira)<br/>Let’s get his shit out.<br/>(to Jing)<br/>Watch him. And call Unlimited. Tell them we need a van and a driver ASAP. A <i>woman</i> driver.<div className="spacer"></div>Rose obediently follows Lupe, Flo and Akira inside. Standing on the lawn, Jing holds both heels in one hand. While keeping a close eye on Larry, she calls Unlimited.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 1<br/>(to Man 2, teasing)<br/>Better treat Maria right, Albert, or you’re next.<div className="spacer"></div>Man 2 chuckles. Dave's unsure how to react to Man 1’s joke.<div className="spacer"></div>LATER<div className="spacer"></div>Most of Larry’s belongings sit outside Townhouse #8. Jing, still holding her heels, stands alone on the grass, monitoring Larry.<div className="spacer"></div>Larry’s friend, GEORGE, happens to walk down the block. He’s surprised to see his huge friend with a bloody face.<div className="spacer"></div>GEORGE<br/>What the hell happened to you?<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>These cunts think they can throw me out of my place.<div className="spacer"></div>George clocks short, skinny Jing—heels at the ready—standing alone in Townhouse #8’s yard.<div className="spacer"></div>GEORGE<br/>(incredulous)<br/>What!?<div className="spacer"></div>Jing sprints to Townhouse #8’s door, jerks it open.<div className="spacer"></div>JING<br/>(yelling into house)<br/><i>GIRLS!</i><div className="spacer"></div>From their beach chairs, Dave and Man 1 and 2 look on, as Lupe, Akira and Flo quickly emerge from Townhouse #8. The three women join Jing on the grass, ready to fight for what they're doing.<div className="spacer"></div>All four women glare at George standing across the street with Larry.<div className="spacer"></div>GEORGE<br/>Ah, hell no—I don’t need this.<br/>(to Larry)<br/>Sorry, bud.<div className="spacer"></div>George resumes walking down the block.<div className="spacer"></div>Lupe, Akira and Flo get back to removing Larry’s things from the apartment. Jing keeps watching Larry. <div className="spacer"></div>LATER<div className="spacer"></div>Akira and Rose set down Larry’s last possession.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(to Rose)<br/>Anything else of his in there?<div className="spacer"></div>Rose walks inside. Moments later, she comes out.<div className="spacer"></div>ROSE<br/>The TV’s his.<div className="spacer"></div>Akira helps Rose carry out Larry’s TV. <div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>Let’s check the whole place again.<div className="spacer"></div>Lupe, Flo, Akira and Rose re–enter the townhouse. <div className="spacer"></div>Another friend of Larry’s, CARL, inadvertently strolls up the block. Larry’s bloody state shocks him.<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>I’m being thrown out of my place.<div className="spacer"></div>Carl looks in disbelief at tiny Jing on Townhouse #8’s lawn.<div className="spacer"></div>CARL<br/>(indicating Larry’s bloody face)<br/>That little woman did this to you?<div className="spacer"></div>Embarrassed, Larry says nothing. <div className="spacer"></div>Carl and Larry start slowly across the street toward Jing.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 2<br/>(to Man 1 and Dave)<br/>Uh–oh.<div className="spacer"></div>JING<br/>(into house)<br/><i>GIRLS!</i><div className="spacer"></div>MAN 2<br/>Time to call 911?<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 1<br/>Maybe.<div className="spacer"></div>When Lupe, Akira and Flo rush out—combining forces with Jing—Carl and Larry stop at the near curb, fifteen feet from the fierce women.<div className="spacer"></div>CARL<br/>(to Women)<br/>Hey, that ain’t fair. Two against four.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>You fight your way, we’ll fight ours.<div className="spacer"></div>After considering the situation, Carl continues up the block.<div className="spacer"></div>CARL<br/>(calling back)<br/>Sorry, dude. Apologize for whatever you did. Maybe they’ll forgive you.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(loud)<br/>He beats his girlfriend—that’s what he does! We warned him—now he’s out!<div className="spacer"></div>Carl throws up his hands in surrender, turns left at the corner. <div className="spacer"></div>Larry returns to the sidewalk across the street.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 2<br/>(to Man 1 and Dave)<br/>I guess we don’t need 911.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>No.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 1<br/>Not yet, anyway.<div className="spacer"></div>The Unlimited van arrives with a <i>MALE</i> DRIVER.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(to Jing, concerned)<br/>Didn’t you ask for a woman?<div className="spacer"></div>JING<br/>I did.<div className="spacer"></div>Lupe marches to Male Driver’s window.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(firm)<br/>Be a good guy and there’ll be no trouble.<div className="spacer"></div>Lupe turns her attention to Larry, points to the van’s passenger seat.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(an order)<br/>In.<div className="spacer"></div>Larry sulkily climbs in the van. He looks at the Male Driver.<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>(man to man)<br/>I ought to have these cunts arrested.<div className="spacer"></div>Not sure what to say, Male Driver says nothing.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(to Akira, Flo and Jing)<br/>Toss his shit in the van. I’ll watch him.<div className="spacer"></div>Male Driver doesn’t want trouble, so he opens the van’s side and rear doors.<div className="spacer"></div>While Lupe minds Larry, the other women load Larry’s things.<div className="spacer"></div>LATER <div className="spacer"></div>All that Larry owns is in the van. Lupe hands Male Driver Larry’s phone, cash and wallet.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>Take him wherever he wants to go, the farther the better. <br/>(a warning)<br/>But don’t bring him back. You hear me?<div className="spacer"></div>Male Driver nods. He cranks the engine, drives away with Larry.<div className="spacer"></div>Lupe gives Akira her keys.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>Hon, get my truck. We’re moving Rose to my place.<div className="spacer"></div>Rose doesn’t protest.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(to Flo and Jing)<br/>Let’s help Rose get her stuff out. <div className="spacer"></div>Lupe looks at Dave and Man 1 and 2.<div className="spacer"></div>LUPE<br/>(not unpleasantly)<br/>You’re welcome to help, gentlemen.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave and Man 1 and 2 slowly rise from their beach chairs. They follow Lupe, Akira and Rose inside.<div className="spacer"></div>LATER<div className="spacer"></div>Everything of Rose’s sits on the lawn. <div className="spacer"></div>Akira pulls up in Lupe’s old pickup. She and Lupe, Jing, Flo, Rose and the three Men load Rose’s things into the truck bed. <div className="spacer"></div>Lupe, Rose and Flo climb in the cab. Jing and Akira find spots among Rose’s stuff. <div className="spacer"></div>Then the pickup drives off toward Lupe’s.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 2<br/>(to Man 1 and Dave)<br/>Well, that was interesting.<div className="spacer"></div>MAN 1<br/>It’ll be boring, compared to what just went down. But I’m going to watch wrestling.<div className="spacer"></div>Man 1 and 2 make their way home. Dave heads back to Townhouse #16. <div className="spacer"></div>INT. DAVE AND KEISHA’S TOWNHOUSE (#16) – VARIOUS – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Dave stops at the bottom of the stairs.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>(calling up to bedroom)<br/>Hon, you want some lunch?<div className="spacer"></div>Keisha sounds like she’s just woken from a deep sleep.<div className="spacer"></div>KEISHA (O.S.)<br/>Okay.<br/>(groggy)<br/>What happened outside?<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/>I’ll tell you when you come down.<div className="spacer"></div>Dave walks to the kitchen. He opens the refrigerator, stares at the food inside.<div className="spacer"></div>He closes the refrigerator without removing anything, then grabs their bottle of cheap whiskey from a cabinet. <div className="spacer"></div>After pouring himself a healthy dose, he takes a sip.<div className="spacer"></div>He studies his shaking hands, drains the glass.<div className="spacer"></div>He thinks about what he witnessed outside.<div className="spacer"></div>DAVE<br/><i>Phew.</i><div className="spacer"></div><u><center>THE END</center></u>

         MONTAGE: TWO PRE–TEEN BROTHERS PALLING AROUND<div className="spacer"></div>It's 1979 in a working–class American suburb. BILLY, 10, and JOEY, 9, walk home from school, talking animatedly. They wear identical Catholic school uniforms and carry knapsacks. Fall foliage lights up the neighborhood.<div className="spacer"></div>A year younger, Joey is taller and huskier than Billy, but it’s never been an issue—they’re good pals.<div className="spacer"></div>SUPERIMPOSE: 1979<div className="spacer"></div>Billy and Joey eat a snack and talk at the kitchen table, while their mother, ANNE, washes dishes at the sink.<div className="spacer"></div>The street and ranch house in which Billy and Joey live are now covered in snow.<div className="spacer"></div>Wearing flannel pajamas, Billy and Joey read in their bunk beds, Joey on the bottom bunk, Billy on the top bunk. Occasionally one makes a comment the other enjoys.<div className="spacer"></div>It’s summer. In the street, Billy and Joey throw a baseball back and forth, bantering good–naturedly.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. BILLY AND JOEY’S SMALL FRONT LAWN – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>A few neighborhood BOYS laugh and horse–around on the grass. Billy and Joey, now 12 and 11, play–fight.<div className="spacer"></div>The younger Joey gets Billy on the ground and straddles him.<div className="spacer"></div>They’re just playing, having fun, laughing.<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY, older but smaller than Billy and Joey, storms over.<div className="spacer"></div>LARRY<br/>(to Billy, outraged)<br/>You let your younger brother beat you up!?<div className="spacer"></div>Beneath his younger brother, Billy’s face tightens. Larry, in effect, is calling Billy a “pussy,” which enrages Billy.<div className="spacer"></div>MONTAGE: BILLY TRAINS TO NEVER FEEL LIKE A “PUSSY” AGAIN<div className="spacer"></div>Driven by Larry’s comment, and its huge social significance among boys, over the next two years we see Billy’s body slowly become more muscular, as he performs:<div className="spacer"></div>Jumping jacks.<div className="spacer"></div>Sit–ups.<div className="spacer"></div>Pushups.<div className="spacer"></div>Harder sit–ups.<div className="spacer"></div>Harder push–ups.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. BILLY AND JOEY'S HOUSE – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Day turns into night.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. BASEMENT BEDROOM – NIGHT<div className="spacer"></div>Now 14 and 13, Billy and Joey read in separate beds on opposites sides of the room. They’ve already reached their full adult height and weight. Billy is 5’10 and 155 pounds, Joey 6’1 and 200.<div className="spacer"></div>ANNE (O.S.)<br/>(yelling from upstairs)<br/>Lights out in ten!<div className="spacer"></div>Neither boy looks up from his reading. <div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>(yelling back)<br/>Okay!<div className="spacer"></div>Billy gets up, closes the window, returns to his bed.<div className="spacer"></div>Joey stands, re–opens the window.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>Closed, asshole.<div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>Fuck you.<div className="spacer"></div>The Boys rush from their beds and start fighting. Because of his superior size, at first Joey gains the upper hand. But aided by his mercurial temper, newly muscled body, and a raging refusal to ever again be perceived as weaker than his younger brother, Billy punches Joey with all his might. Joey retreats from the room.<div className="spacer"></div>Billy closes the window, climbs back in bed.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. BOTTOM OF REVERSE–SLOPED DRIVEWAY – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Beside the closed garage door, Billy and Joey, 16 and 15, work on Joey’s bike, which is propped upside down on its handlebars and seat.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>(angry)<br/>Give me the wrench.<div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>(firm)<br/>No.<div className="spacer"></div>Billy pushes Joey and they fight. Billy unleashes a flurry of vicious punches, causing Joey to drop the wrench and walk away.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. LIVING ROOM – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Joey watches a TV show. Billy enters.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>We’re not watching that shit. <div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>I was here first.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>(an order)<br/>Change the channel.<div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>Fuck you.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>Give me the remote.<div className="spacer"></div>Joey doesn’t, so Billy tries grabbing the remote from Joey. Joey leaps to his feet. Standing, they wrestle like animals. Entwined, they fall on the coffee table, breaking it in half.<div className="spacer"></div>Anne marches in.<div className="spacer"></div>ANNE<br/>(rage)<br/><i>YOU BROKE MY GODDAMN TABLE!? GET OUT! BOTH OF YOU!</i><div className="spacer"></div>The Boys leave the room through opposite arches.<div className="spacer"></div>EXT. BOTTOM OF REVERSE–SLOPED DRIVEWAY – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>The garage door’s open. Billy and Joey stand inside, having  been assigned to sweep and organize things. The left side of the garage looks like less work.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>I got the left, you got the right.<div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>No, <i>I</i> got the left.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>Fuck you.<div className="spacer"></div>For a change, Joey confidently steps to Billy, ready to give his smaller older brother the physical comeuppance he’s long deserved.<div className="spacer"></div>Though Billy tries to hide it, his younger but bigger brother’s unexpected move and self–assurance terrify him.<div className="spacer"></div>Their tough–guy FATHER descends the driveway to check on their progress with the garage. He sees they’re about to fight.<div className="spacer"></div>FATHER<br/>Go ahead, I want to see who’s going to win.<div className="spacer"></div>Their Father’s refusal to stop them from fighting increases Billy’s terror.<div className="spacer"></div>Using his Father’s presence as an excuse to not fight Joey, Billy begins cleaning and organizing the left side of the garage.<div className="spacer"></div>Joey’s proud to have intimidated Billy, but disappointed he didn’t get the chance to finally kick his older brother’s ass.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. KITCHEN – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Now 17, Joey sits at the kitchen table.<div className="spacer"></div>Anne’s making hamburgers for him.<div className="spacer"></div>Billy walks in.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>(to Anne)<br/>I have to leave for work. Can I eat first? I can’t be late.<div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>(to Anne)<br/>No way—I was here before him.<div className="spacer"></div>Before Joey can fully rise from his chair, Billy’s gotten him in a headlock and hurled him to the floor.<div className="spacer"></div>Joey, not wanting to anger their mother, calmly stands, returns to his chair.<div className="spacer"></div>Billy heads for the front door.<div className="spacer"></div>ANNE<br/>(to Billy)<br/><i>DON'T COME BACK!</i><div className="spacer"></div>MONTAGE: BILLY AND JOEY’S 47–YEAR ESTRANGEMENT<div className="spacer"></div>Someone offscreen snaps a photo of Billy and Anne at Billy’s college commencement. Joey is conspicuously absent.<div className="spacer"></div>Joey’s graduating college. In cap and gown, he poses for a picture with Anne. Billy’s not there.<div className="spacer"></div>It’s twenty–five years later, and Billy’s now 46. He and his wife Gwen, and Anne—now a grandmother—pose with Billy and Gwen’s son Brian, 21, at Brian’s college commencement.<div className="spacer"></div>The graduation of Joey and Tara's 20–year–old, Danielle. Joey, Tara, Anne and Danielle smile for the camera.<div className="spacer"></div>Twenty more years have passed. Recent retirees Billy and Gwen, and great–grandmother Anne, sit at the dining table with Brian, his wife and their college–age kids.<div className="spacer"></div>Great–grandmother Anne sits at a backyard picnic table with grandparents Joey and Tara. They watch Joey and Danielle's teenagers toss around a frisbee.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. BILLY AND GWEN’S LIVING ROOM – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Gwen and Billy read on the couch.<div className="spacer"></div>Billy finds it hard to focus on his book.<div className="spacer"></div>Gwen puts hers down.<div className="spacer"></div>GWEN<br/>Try him once more. If he doesn’t want to come to the phone, so be it. But it’s been <i>fifty</i> years.<div className="spacer"></div>Billy looks at her, his face full of remorse.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>I just didn’t want to be known as a wuss growing up.<div className="spacer"></div>GWEN<br/>(rhetorical)<br/>So what if someone thought you were a wuss.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>It’s like men raping men in prison. It's not about sex—it's about dominate or be dominated.<div className="spacer"></div>GWEN<br/>(bemused)<br/>What the hell are you talking about?<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>(locking eyes with her)<br/>You’re a terrible mother.<div className="spacer"></div>GWEN<br/>(enraged)<br/>What?!<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>You feel that rage? That’s the pink button you were socialized with. I was socialized with the blue button of not wanting to be a wuss.<div className="spacer"></div>Hurt, Gwen looks at him.<div className="spacer"></div>GWEN<br/>Am I a bad mother?<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>No. But that’s the worst thing anyone could ever say to most women. Or that their kids are brats or losers. Just like when I was young the worst thing anyone could ever say to a guy was he was a pussy.<div className="spacer"></div>Neither speaks for a while. <div className="spacer"></div>GWEN<br/>Whatever.<br/>(long pause)<br/>Try him again. Before you’re both dead.<div className="spacer"></div>After a few moments, Billy apprehensively removes his phone.<div className="spacer"></div>INT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD – DAY<div className="spacer"></div>Joey and Tara barbecue. It’s just the two of them.<div className="spacer"></div>The landline inside the house RINGS. Tara enters the house to answer it.<div className="spacer"></div>She exits holding a cordless phone.<div className="spacer"></div>TARA<br/>(hopeful)<br/>It’s Billy.<div className="spacer"></div>Joey’s face tightens. Tara offers him the phone encouragingly.<div className="spacer"></div>TARA<br/>(tender)<br/>Come on. Life is short. It’s time to end this. For God’s sake, he’s your <i>brother</i>.<div className="spacer"></div>Joey stares at the phone in her hand for a long time.<div className="spacer"></div>Finally, he accepts the phone from her, slowly brings it to his ear.<div className="spacer"></div>INTERCUT<div className="spacer"></div>Gwen softly caresses Billy’s neck. Tara tightly holds Joey from behind.<div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>(into phone, as if to a stranger)<br/>Hello? <div className="spacer"></div>INTERCUT<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>Hey.<div className="spacer"></div>Neither brother speaks for a few moments.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>I’m sorry for what I did growing up.<div className="spacer"></div>There’s another long silence between them. Both men’s eyes glisten.<div className="spacer"></div>JOEY<br/>(finally, voice cracking)<br/>So how’s it hanging?<div className="spacer"></div>Billy smiles bittersweetly at this tough–love invitation back into his brother’s life. Both men are quietly crying now.<div className="spacer"></div>BILLY<br/>(catch in his throat)<br/>Loose. Real loose.<div className="spacer"></div><u><center>THE END</center></u>
